# Dementia-Prediction-Model

Developed a dementia prediction model with machine learning and deep learning techniques, 
achieving 89% accuracy with Random Forest, 88% with Logistic Regression, and 88% accuracy 
with a TensorFlow deep learning model. Enhanced through comprehensive EDA and feature engineering.

Next sprint includes Gradio web interface deployment for real-time predictions on new data.

Dataset:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tsy6rbc5d4/1
This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.
