# Dementia-Prediction-Model

Developed a dementia prediction model with machine learning and deep learning techniques, 
achieving 89% accuracy with Random Forest, 88% with Logistic Regression, and 88% accuracy 
with a TensorFlow deep learning model. Enhanced through comprehensive EDA and feature engineering.

Next sprint includes Gradio web interface deployment for real-time predictions on new data.
